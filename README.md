# Appliances-energy-prediction
Research was carried out to study Ensemble methods, KNN Regression,Support Vector Machine,Linear Regression that can be used for prediction and their accuracy were compared. This research concludes that accuracy obtained by Extra tree regressor was highest, further it was inferred that it can be made efficient by combination of different techniques and parameter tuning.
We are given a dataset having 19735 rows and 29 columns.A lot of work has been carried out to predict appliance energy usage with the help of this dataset.
We study various different Machine Learning algorithms that can be used for prediction of energy usage.
